<h1> TV Series Repository with C# </h1>

Hey recruiter :wave:! 

My name is Jo√£o, I have been paving my way into becoming a fullstack developer, this project was created with the goal of being a TV Series Repository using <b>C# </b>:happy: 

It is part of a bootcamp I've been working on. It is not a final build, so, it may be improved at any given time. 

<h2> CRUD </h2>

The current repository was developed using the appropriate CRUD storage recommend rules to:

<ul> <b>C</b>reate </ul> 

<ul> <b>R</b>ead </ul> 

<ul> <b>U</b>pdate </ul> 

<ul> <b>D</b>elete </ul> 

<h4> Suggestions and recruiting messages are encouraged </h4>
